The following instructions for installing  JNI libraries used by kodkod work only on UNIX-like systems 
(Mac OS X, Linux, Cygwin).

Requirements:  java 1.5x

cd [the parent directory of the nativesolver directory]
mkdir bin
javac -d bin/ nativesolver/Make.java
java -cp bin/ nativesolver.Make -d nativesolver

If the installation was successful, the following message will be printed to the console: 

make -C [...]/nativesolver all
Created the libraries.

This creates the zchaff and minisat JNIs and puts them into a directory from which they can be loaded at runtime.
